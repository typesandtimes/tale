A new year in the Common Era has arrived, surely to inundate us all with visual acuity puns. But has _a new decade_ also arrived?

The question has percolated through the loud void of social media, reverberating across [digital content mills and respectable media outlets alike](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=is+2020+a+new+decade&t=h_&ia=news). We all find ourselves burning with new intensity, searching for any authoritative voice to make sense of this quandary. _[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/28/us/what-is-decade.html), [Farmer's Almanac](https://www.farmersalmanac.com/new-decade-2020-or-2021-100900), [Timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/decade.html), please somebody tell us!_

In an earlier time, the Pope himself might have served as just such an authority. After all, our calendar isn't called "[Gregorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_XIII)" for nothing. What we're missing is a _formal standardization_ for the concept of the decade. To borrow the visual acuity pun, [20/20](https://www.aoa.org/patients-and-public/eye-and-vision-problems/glossary-of-eye-and-vision-conditions/visual-acuity) enjoys [formal standardization](http://www.icoph.org/dynamic/attachments/resources/icovisualacuity1984.pdf) by the International Council of Ophthalmology while 2020 enjoys no such thing, at least not one with the clout to bring an authoritative answer.

Instead, in true postmodern fashion, people must hash out their own understanding of the decade question without any authoritative answer, or perhaps, with all too many authoritative answers. Recent articles on the subject have consulted [meteorological associations](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2020/01/01/is-2020-the-start-of-a-new-decadea-human-technical-and-climate-perspective/#18ed2fd3ee2f), [philosophy professors](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/12/10/2020-start-new-decade-some-say-thats-not-until-2021/4366467002/), and [the United States Naval Observatory](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/28/us/what-is-decade.html).




Some might recall similar questions about the true beginning of the new millennium: the first of January, but 2000 or 2001? Paleontologist and public intellectual Stephen Jay Gould wrote his 1997 book _[Questioning the Millennium](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674061644)_ on precisely this question, filling its pages with historical and pop culture debates. (Spoiler alert: it was 2001.)

Less grandiose but more rife with historical evidence is the century question: do centuries begin in years ending with `00` or with `01`? The end of the 20th century, _[la fin de siècle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin_de_si%C3%A8cle)_ as it was known in France and in high culture, garnered tremendous attention worldwide. Philosophers, intellectuals, journalists, emperors, and popes all debated and ruled on the exact beginning of the 20th century, their efforts published for mass audiences in the world's newspapers. In response, where today we have social media, back then they had letters to the editor.

And then finally there's the decade question. A millennium is grandiose. A century is once in a lifetime. But a decade? That's pedestrian. Indeed, among these three different periodizations of history, the decade stands alone as a 20th-century concept with largely cultural definition.



* * *

When asked whether 2020 marks a new decade, people fall into two camps, which I'll call the _Digitals_ and the _Ordinals_.

* The Digitals answer _yes, for decades are identified by their digit representations_. The previous decade, the 2010s, included the years 2010 through 2019, while the new decade, the 2020s, includes the years 2020 through 2029.

* The Ordinals, on the other hand, answer _no, for decades are identified by ordinal numbers counted in sequence from the beginning_. The current decade, the 202nd (or the 2nd of the 21st century), includes the years 2011 through 2020, while the next decade, the 203rd, will include the years 2021 through 2030.

These two camps are both so rational and natural that a person in one camp might deny the very existence of the other. Not since 2015 --- is that still this decade? --- and "[the dress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress)" have two camps formed so resolutely online. Are they not both completely legitimate ways to count off the decades? Let's evaluate these camps as applied to another periodization: centuries.

To count centuries, the Digitals would say that we're in _the 2000s_, running from 2000 to 2099, and last we were in _the 1900s_, running from 1900 to 1999. Surely one cannot deny the legitimacy of referring to centuries as such. The Ordinals, on the other hand, would say that we're in the _the 21st century_, running from 2001 to 2100, and last we were in _the 20th century_, running from 1901 to 2000.

At the level of centuries, this debate has raged for... centuries, most notably the transition from 19th to 20th centuries. Stephen Jay Gould deemed the debate to be one between "high culture" on one side -- the scholarly mantle of Ordinals -- and "vernacular culture" on the other -- the common-sense laurels of Cardinals.[^gouldculture] On the high culture side stood Pope Leo XIII,[^popeaddress] astronomers going back centuries,[^loc] and many newspaper editors.




On the vernacular culture side stood Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, the Wellesley College president, and a great many letters to the editor.

"Such technical accuracy, however, is at odds with the way we count ages, money, or miles, and the change of initial numerals from, say, 1999 to 2000 is far more appealing as a dividing line than the relatively minor change from, say, 2000 to 2001."[^schwartz]
