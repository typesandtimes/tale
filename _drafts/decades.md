A new year in the Common Era has arrived, surely to inundate us all with visual acuity puns. But has _a new decade_ also arrived?

The question has percolated through the loud void of social media, reverberating across [digital content mills and respectable media outlets alike](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=is+2020+a+new+decade&t=h_&ia=news). We all find ourselves burning with new intensity, searching for any authoritative voice to make sense of this quandary. _[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/28/us/what-is-decade.html), [Farmer's Almanac](https://www.farmersalmanac.com/new-decade-2020-or-2021-100900), [Timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/decade.html), please somebody tell us!_

In an earlier time, the Pope himself might have served as just such an authority. After all, our calendar isn't called "[Gregorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_XIII)" for nothing. What we're missing is a _formal standardization_ for the concept of the decade. To borrow the visual acuity pun, [20/20](https://www.aoa.org/patients-and-public/eye-and-vision-problems/glossary-of-eye-and-vision-conditions/visual-acuity) enjoys [formal standardization](http://www.icoph.org/dynamic/attachments/resources/icovisualacuity1984.pdf) by the International Council of Ophthalmology while 2020 enjoys no such thing, at least not one with the clout to bring an authoritative answer.

Instead, in true postmodern fashion, people must hash out their own understanding of the decade question without any authoritative answer, or perhaps, with all too many authoritative answers. Recent articles on the subject have consulted [meteorological associations](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2020/01/01/is-2020-the-start-of-a-new-decadea-human-technical-and-climate-perspective/#18ed2fd3ee2f), [philosophy professors](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/12/10/2020-start-new-decade-some-say-thats-not-until-2021/4366467002/), and [the United States Naval Observatory](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/28/us/what-is-decade.html).




Some might recall similar questions about the true beginning of the new millennium: the first of January, but 2000 or 2001? Paleontologist and public intellectual Stephen Jay Gould wrote his 1997 book _[Questioning the Millennium](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674061644)_ on precisely this question, filling its pages with historical and pop culture debates. (Spoiler alert: it was 2001.)

Less grandiose but more rife with historical evidence is the century question: do centuries begin in years ending with `00` or with `01`? The end of the 19th century, _[la fin de siècle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin_de_si%C3%A8cle)_ as it was known in France and in high culture, garnered tremendous attention worldwide. Philosophers, intellectuals, journalists, emperors, and popes all debated and ruled on the exact beginning of the 20th century, their efforts published for mass audiences in the world's newspapers. In response, where today we have social media, back then they had letters to the editor.

Have you wondered whether we've started a new decade as much as this person? "[Wann fängt das XIX. Jahrhundert an?](https://books.google.com/books?id=tRVDAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA857&lpg=PA857&dq=%22Wann+fangt+das+XIX.+Jahrhundert+an?%22&source=bl&ots=rn7HjVD-2F&sig=ACfU3U3D1TvWV04VyzhSD1mx9GH6xczr_Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi44ZLTi-nmAhXjV98KHWmHC2QQ6AEwA3oECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Wann%20fangt%20das%20XIX.%20Jahrhundert%20an%3F%22&f=false)" ("When Does the 19th Century Begin?") _Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung_, 18 September 1799.

And then finally there's the decade question. A millennium is grandiose. A century is once in a lifetime. But a decade? That's pedestrian. Indeed, among these three periodizations of history, the decade stands alone as being primarily cultural in nature. 
"Decades are not a function of calendar time," states Newsweek journalist Bill Barol. "They are trends, values, and associations, bundled up and tied together in the national memory."[^newsweek]

# The Two Camps

When asked whether 2020 marks a new decade, people fall into two camps, which I'll call the _Cardinals_ and the _Ordinals_.

* The Cardinals answer _yes, for decades are identified by their digit representations_. The previous decade, the 2010s, included the years 2010 through 2019, while the new decade, the 2020s, includes the years 2020 through 2029.

* The Ordinals, on the other hand, answer _no, for decades are identified by ordinal numbers counted in sequence from the beginning_. The current decade, the 202nd (or the 2nd of the 21st century), includes the years 2011 through 2020, while the next decade, the 203rd, will include the years 2021 through 2030.

These two camps are both so rational and natural that a person in one camp might deny the very existence of the other. Not since 2015 --- is that still this decade? --- and "[the dress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress)" have two camps formed so resolutely online. Are they not both completely legitimate ways to count off the decades? Let's evaluate these camps as applied to another periodization: centuries.

To count centuries, the Cardinals would say that we're in _the 2000s_, running from 2000 to 2099, and last we were in _the 1900s_, running from 1900 to 1999. Surely one cannot deny the legitimacy of referring to centuries as such. The Ordinals, on the other hand, would say that we're in the _the 21st century_, running from 2001 to 2100, and last we were in _the 20th century_, running from 1901 to 2000.

At the level of centuries, this debate has raged for... centuries, most notably the transition from 19th to 20th centuries. Stephen Jay Gould deemed the debate to be one between "high culture" on one side --- the scholarly mantle of Ordinals --- and "vernacular culture" on the other --- the common-sense laurels of Cardinals, most notably expressed in the 1890s.[^gouldculture]
A century later, he remarks, it would be Arthur C. Clarke's _2001_ vs. Prince's _1999_.

On the side of high culture, insisting that centuries begin in the `01` years, stood Pope Leo XIII,[^popeaddress] astronomers going back centuries,[^loc] and many newspaper editors. They even recognized the distinction as one between cardinal and ordinal numbers, going back at least to 1699.[^delaisement]

	caption=three_articles_caption %}

On the side of vernacular culture, arguing for the `00` years, stood Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany,[^kaiser] the Wellesley College president,[^colleges] and --- most importantly --- the common man. One such common man articulated his position on the "great secular event" of the turn of the century as a populist backlash to "the abacists":

> Shall we wait now a whole year for 1901, at the behest of the abacists? No, we will not pass over the significant year 1900, which is stamped with the great secular change, but with cheers we will welcome it and the new century. The 1900 men, who compose the vast majority of the people, say to their opponents: "We freely admit that the century you have in your mind, the artificial century, begins in 1901, but the natural century (which we prefer) begins in 1900."[^abacists]

In the end, with the intelligentsia on their side the Ordinals won the debate on centuries, as long as the ordinally-specified phrase "the \_\_th century" remains the common expression for centurial periods of history. Then do they also win the debate on decades?

# What's a Decade Anyway?

Without the grandeur of a century, the decade question has prompted far less (serious) debate. The decade, as a periodization of history, is a fairly recent concept. In the 1940s historian Marc Bloch had already warned against the "insidious" practice of periodizing by centuries:
> We no longer name ages after their heroes. We very prudently number them in sequence every hundred years, starting from a point fixed, once and for all, at the year 1 of the Christian era. [...] Unfortunately, no law of history enjoins that only those years whose dates end with the figures '01' coincide with the critical points of human evolution.[^bloch]

If centurial thinking already had "no rational basis," what about the decade? Warren Susman criticized it as "a special and perhaps characteristically American way of seeing the past: as a series of decades that fit neatly into limits imposed by man-made calendars."[^susman] Jason Scott Smith, in his 1997 article "[The Strange History of the Decade](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3789661)," traces the history of the decade in primarily American, primarily cultural thought.[^smith] "The decade contributes to an abbreviated historical attention span---cause and effect are confused, and the record of the past is reduced to a 'progression of cultural styles.'" When did this begin? According to Smith, oweing to the World War, to global revolutions of technology and politics, and to a subsequent decade full of nostalgia, the 1920s were "the first decade truly to legitimate a ten-year span of time as a historic category."

Smith:
* the 1920s was "the first decade truly to legitimate a ten-year span of time as a historic category."
* "Allen employed the decade as a device to organize and to describe culturally shared events, rather than treating it as an arbitrarily strict unit of historic time."
* "A rising sense of generational self-awareness, the perceived acceleration of time, a sense of the new, combined with a growing identification between the forces of youth culture and the phenomenon of cultural rebirth, replaced the linear, progressive conception of time that had dominated the thinking of much of the nineteenth century."
* "Decades are not a function of calendar time," states Newsweek journalist Bill Barol. "They are trends, values, and associations, bundled up and tied together in the national memory."
* "Periodizing history via the decade is just one example of a broader tendency in American culture, the process of 'disremembering the past while historicizing the present.' The decade contributes to an abbreviated historical attention span---cause and effect are confused, and the record of the past is reduced to a 'progression of cultural styles.'"
* NYT article: "What's in a decade, anyway? And how is it that this arbitrary and slim crosscutting of time, a mere 10 years, has grown and flourished to the point that we all walk around in a self-conscious haze about what a new decade represents even before the previous one has tolled its last?"

This difference in the idea of the decade, as compared to centuries, also matches the common language to talk about them. Here, the Cardinals have the advantage: you're far less likely to hear talk of "the 203rd decade" than "the 2020s." The situation is reversed for centuries: "the 21st century" is more common than "the 2000s." While it's not immediately clear how to search for "the \_\_s" vs. "the \_\_ century" or "decade," we can at least compare the frequency of the ordinal reference to "centuries" vs. to "decades," which [the following Google Ngram Viewer results](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=_NUM_+st+century+%2B+_NUM_+nd+century+%2B+_NUM_+rd+century+%2B+_NUM_+th+century%2C_NUM_+st+decade+%2B+_NUM_+nd+decade+%2B+_NUM_+rd+decade+%2B+_NUM_+th+decade&case_insensitive=on&year_start=1700&year_end=2020&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2C%28_NUM_%20st%20century%20%2B%20%20_NUM_%20nd%20century%20%2B%20%20_NUM_%20rd%20century%20%2B%20%20_NUM_%20th%20century%29%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2C%28_NUM_%20st%20decade%20%2B%20%20_NUM_%20nd%20decade%20%2B%20%20_NUM_%20rd%20decade%20%2B%20%20_NUM_%20th%20decade%29%3B%2Cc0) show.

Taking the cardinal invocation of decades to be far more common than the ordinal invocation, it seems to me that the Cardinals win the decade debate; the decades begin on the `00` years. This is the opposite of century counting, though the distinction in the concept of the decade seems to warrant the distinction in the counting.

But without some kind of standard or formal definition to back it up, why trust this outcome? Who can more authoritatively answer?
