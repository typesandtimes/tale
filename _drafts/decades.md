A new year in the Common Era has arrived, surely to inundate us all with visual acuity puns. But has _a new decade_ also arrived?

The question has percolated through the loud void of social media, reverberating across [digital content mills and respectable media outlets alike](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=is+2020+a+new+decade&t=h_&ia=news). We all find ourselves burning with new intensity, searching for any authoritative voice to make sense of this quandary. _[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/28/us/what-is-decade.html), [Farmer's Almanac](https://www.farmersalmanac.com/new-decade-2020-or-2021-100900), [Timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/decade.html), please somebody tell us!_

In an earlier time, the Pope himself might have served as just such an authority. After all, our calendar isn't called "[Gregorian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_XIII)" for nothing. What we're missing is a _formal standardization_ for the concept of the decade. To borrow the visual acuity pun, [20/20](https://www.aoa.org/patients-and-public/eye-and-vision-problems/glossary-of-eye-and-vision-conditions/visual-acuity) enjoys [formal standardization](http://www.icoph.org/dynamic/attachments/resources/icovisualacuity1984.pdf) by the International Council of Ophthalmology while 2020 enjoys no such thing, at least not one with the clout to bring an authoritative answer.

Instead, in true postmodern fashion, people must hash out their own understanding of the decade question without any authoritative answer, or perhaps, with all too many authoritative answers. Recent articles on the subject have consulted [meteorological associations](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marshallshepherd/2020/01/01/is-2020-the-start-of-a-new-decadea-human-technical-and-climate-perspective/#18ed2fd3ee2f), [philosophy professors](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/12/10/2020-start-new-decade-some-say-thats-not-until-2021/4366467002/), and [the United States Naval Observatory](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/28/us/what-is-decade.html).




Some might recall similar questions about the true beginning of the new millennium: the first of January, but 2000 or 2001? Paleontologist and public intellectual Stephen Jay Gould wrote his 1997 book _[Questioning the Millennium](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674061644)_ on precisely this question, filling its pages with historical and pop culture debates. (Spoiler alert: it was 2001.)

Less grandiose but more rife with historical evidence is the century question: do centuries begin in years ending with `00` or with `01`? The end of the 20th century, _[la fin de siècle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin_de_si%C3%A8cle)_ as it was known in France and in high culture, garnered tremendous attention worldwide. Philosophers, intellectuals, journalists, emperors, and popes all debated and ruled on the exact beginning of the 20th century, their efforts published for mass audiences in the world's newspapers. In response, where today we have social media, back then they had letters to the editor.

And then finally there's the decade question. A millennium is grandiose. A century is once in a lifetime. But a decade? That's pedestrian. Indeed, among these three different periodizations of history, the decade stands alone as a 20th-century concept with largely cultural definition.



* * *

When asked whether 2020 marks a new decade, people fall into two camps, which I'll call the _Digitals_ and the _Ordinals_.

* The Digitals answer _yes, for decades are identified by their digit representations_. The previous decade, the 2010s, included the years 2010 through 2019, while the new decade, the 2020s, includes the years 2020 through 2029.

* The Ordinals, on the other hand, answer _no, for decades are identified by ordinal numbers counted in sequence from the beginning_. The current decade, the 202nd (or the 2nd of the 21st century), includes the years 2011 through 2020, while the next decade, the 203rd, will include the years 2021 through 2030.

These two camps are both so rational and natural that a person in one camp might deny the very existence of the other. Not since 2015 --- is that still this decade? --- and "[the dress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress)" have two camps formed so resolutely online. Are they not both completely legitimate ways to count off the decades? Let's evaluate these camps as applied to another periodization: centuries.

To count centuries, the Digitals would say that we're in _the 2000s_, running from 2000 to 2099, and last we were in _the 1900s_, running from 1900 to 1999. Surely one cannot deny the legitimacy of referring to centuries as such. The Ordinals, on the other hand, would say that we're in the _the 21st century_, running from 2001 to 2100, and last we were in _the 20th century_, running from 1901 to 2000.

At the level of centuries, this debate has raged for... centuries, most notably the transition from 19th to 20th centuries. Stephen Jay Gould deemed the debate to be one between "high culture" on one side --- the scholarly mantle of Ordinals --- and "vernacular culture" on the other --- the common-sense laurels of Cardinals, most notably expressed in the 1890s.[^gouldculture]
A century later, he remarks, it would be Arthur C. Clarke's _2001_ vs. Prince's _1999_.

On the side of high culture, insisting that centuries begin in the `01` years, stood Pope Leo XIII,[^popeaddress] astronomers going back centuries,[^loc] and many newspaper editors. They even recognized the distinction as one between cardinal and ordinal numbers, going back at least to 1699.[^delaisement]

On the side of vernacular culture, arguing for the `00` years, stood Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany,[^kaiser] the Wellesley College president,[^colleges] and --- most importantly --- the common man. One such common man articulated his position on the "great secular event" of the turn of the century as a populist backlash to "the abacists":

> Shall we wait now a whole year for 1901, at the behest of the abacists? No, we will not pass over the significant year 1900, which is stamped with the great secular change, but with cheers we will welcome it and the new century. The 1900 men, who compose the vast majority of the people, say to their opponents: 'We freely admit that the century you have in your mind, the artificial century, begins in 1901, but the natural century (which we prefer) begins in 1900.'[^abacists]

[^colleges]:
    At the end of 1899 the Boston Herald asked an array of college presidents to conclusivey determine the year that begins the 20th century. In the December 10th issue they published the results in a huge spread, along with a history of calendar systems. Colleges whose presidents or other professors correctly said 1901: Princeton, Cornell, Columbia, Penn, Vassar, Bowdoin, Dartmouth, Brown, Yale, Harvard, and Chicago. Those who incorrectly answered 1900: Wellesley, Tufts, and Smith. Elsewhere the New York Tribune editor writes of the 1900 error: "This notion has about disappeared, however, before the gaze of calm eyed mathematics. The only persons of prominence who ever held it were the president of Wellesley College and the German Emperor" (12 December 1899, "[La Fin de Siecle](https://www.newspapers.com/image/206532828/?terms=wellesley)").
