One hundred years ago today, on 19 May 1919, one-third of the population of
the town of Amherst, Nova Scotia --- women and men alike --- launched a three-week
general strike. The primary demand of the strikers was to shorten the work day
from ten hours to nine. But among the targets of their anger was the
"capitalist plot" of daylight saving time (DST).

The small maritime industrial town boomed up until the end of the First World
War, producing rail and defense equipment. But a decade of deindustrialization
decimated the jobs in the town as factory owners moved westward into the
increasingly centralized Canadian economy. As soldiers returned home from the
war, jobs were scarce; mass industrial actions and news of the Bolshevik
revolution were both on the rise; and the town of Winnipeg, Manitoba had
launched a general strike only days before.

Chief among the strikers’ demands was to shorten the work day from ten hours
to nine, at the same weekly pay. For these strikers, the bosses’ control over
their time --- in the length of the work day --- fused with the government’s
control over their time --- with the official observance of DST. It was only
natural, then, for their anger to spread to the latter.

Canada followed the US into nationwide DST in 1918, causing mass anger from
farmers in rural areas of Canada and many blue collar workers in the towns and
cities; it was the same in the US. For these workers it meant waking up at an
unnatural solar time, before the society around them begins the rhythms of the
day. They're the ones who already had to wake up before everyone else, after
all. Notably, however, it was far from consensus for all but the farmers.

The next year, with the war and ostensible justification for DST at an end,
Ottawa decided to leave the DST issue to individual cities to mandate, as did
the US, not wanting to risk more popular anger. Now with DST being decided by
the individual cities, it became a hotly debated issue across Canada in the
spring: _will our town change the clocks again?_

Virtually every newspaper published editorials and commentary about DST, as
they did in 1916 when the idea first achieved national recognition by some
countries during the war.

As the working class anger over _time_ grew in Amherst, the newly organized
Amherst Federation of Labor made sure to squash DST in their town. At one town
discussion about DST before the strike erupted,

> 300 Amherst Federation of Labor members marched to the public meeting and
> “hooted down” daylight saving proponents. [One union leader] charged angrily
> that daylight saving was a capitalist plot to lengthen the working day.

The town was subsequently not one of the many Canadian municipalities to
observe DST in 1919.

After a weeks-long strike by a sizable portion of the working men and women
in the town, most employers conceded the nine hour day, if not also the ten
hour pay. The Amherst workers won a twofold victory over the control of their
time.

In the hundred years since, all of North America has adopted nationwide
daylight saving time policies. Moreover, large swathes of North America have
experienced more deindustrialization as production moves not to inland Canada
but around the globe. One wonders whether new demands for shorter work days
will spring up again in North America --- and whether those demands will be
linked explicitly to daylight saving time.
